# About
This repo contains open source contract forms that address typical early-stage corporate transactions. It is curated by Adler Vermillion & Skocilich LLP, based on our experience negotiating and documenting similar deals for our clients. Our intent is to propose standards that will be both fair and practical regardless of one’s perspective. We hope that other practitioners will use and contribute to these forms.

# Acknowledgements
We were inspired by the efforts of our friends at Docracy, and by Jason Boehmig, who is curating the Series Seed forms at Fenwick & West.
# Proper Use of Templates
We are providing these forms “as-is” so that they can be used, and hopefully improved by exposure to criticism and testing. We are not giving any individually-tailored legal advice, or any legal advice at all, so please do not rely on anything we or anyone else says in this repository or related comments. While we may discuss hypothetical scenarios to help revise the documents, please do not send us any confidential information about your legal matters or those of your clients or friends.
